# Pix2Persona Dataset

This repository contains the dataset and resources related to our paper:

**[From Pixels to Personas: Investigating and Modeling Self-Anthropomorphism in Human-Robot Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03870)**

## Overview

The **Pix2Persona** dataset is a unique compilation designed to study self-anthropomorphism in human-robot dialogues. Our dataset includes 15 existing dialogue datasets with additional annotations. Each dialogue turn is accompanied by two additional bot responses, enabling further analysis of self-anthropomorphic (SA) and non-self-anthropomorphic (NSA) responses.

## Dataset Contents

- **15 Dialogue Datasets**: Each dataset is enriched with two types of responses per dialogue turn.
- **SA/NSA Responses**: Custom bot responses are provided for every dialogue turn to enable comparison and study of self-anthropomorphic tendencies.
